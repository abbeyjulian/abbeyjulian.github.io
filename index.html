					<h1>About Me</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>I am a first-year PhD student in <a href=http://www.cs.emory.edu/graduate/general-information/>Computer Science and Informatics at Emory University</a>. I am interested in researching numerical linear algebra and its applications to other areas of Computer Science. I am also interested in Computer Science Education and strategies for effectively teaching students who have grown up in the "age of technology." I love quiet mornings with a cup of coffee, trying out new dinner recipes, and exploring Atlanta with my husband.</p>

					<h2>Building a GAN for Systems Workloads</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Fall 2019 - Present</p>
					<p class="subDetails">with Professor Avani Wildani and Vishwanath Seshagiri</p>
					<p>Being able to predict the type of workloads a system might encounter can help design more effective and efficient systems protocols. However, workload datasets are incredibly private (because of the proprietary information it might disclose), and the few publically availble datasets are not enough to lead to good predictive models. We hope to build a Generative Adversarial Network that can generate synthetic but informative workloads that could be used in workload prediction models.</p>

					<h2>How Introductory Computer Science Students Develop Programming Style</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Fall 2019 - Present</p>
					<p class="subDetails">with Professor Davide Fossati, Professor Navid Hashemi, and Malvern Madondo</p>
					<p>Emory University's introductory Computer Science course uses a system called QTest where students are able to type and execute code from within the system. We are interested in analyzing the data collected by QTest, including the temporal data of how a student created and edited a piece of code, to learn more about how students new to Computer Science develop coding strategies and style.</p>

					<h2>Anki for First-Year Medical School Anatomy</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Spring 2019</p>
					<p class="subDetails">with Andrew Rees, Mark Naguib, and Bailey Pearson</p>
					<p>Anki is an open-source flashcard platform well-suited to studying for a medical school anatomy course. As part of a Medical Education research project, I consulted on the development of a Python plugin for the Anki platform that would collect and analyze data on student studying that can be aggregated to provide real-time feedback to a course professor. This work is being pilot-tested at the Vanderbilt University Medical School.</br>Poster presented at <a href=https://www.ama-assn.org/education/accelerating-change-medical-education/2019-changemeded>AMA ChangeMedEd 2019</a>.</p>

					<h2>Computational Sustainability and Place-Based Storytelling</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Summer 2018</p>
					<p class="subDetails">with Dr. Douglas H. Fisher, Emily Markert, and Kamala Varma</p>
					<p>The Region Radio project is an on-going project at Vanderbilt University investigating how Artifical Intelligence can be used to created a road trip storyteller that curates a playlist of stories, timed to the trip, that will tell stories about a place as you drive past that place. While working on this project, I looked at how to use Natural Language Processing to introduce and provide context for stories, as well as how to use techniques from Information Retrieval to characterize and measure relevance between a physical place and a text.</br>Late Breaking Paper in <a href=http://computationalcreativity.net/iccc2019/assets/iccc_proceedings_2019.pdf>Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Computational Creativity</a> (pages 336-340)</br>Poster presented at <a href=http://www.compsust.net/compsust-2018/>2018 Doctoral Consortium on Computational Sustainability</a></p>

					<h2>Election Control Algorithmic Complexity</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">2017 - 2018</p>
					<p class="subDetails">with Dr. Yevgeniy Vorobeychik</p>
					<p>Given a set of voting districts and a maximum number of votes to change at each district, we proved that it is NP-Hard to determine at which districts to change votes in order to change the outcome of an election. This is consistent with similar results in other situations of election control algorithmitc study.</p>
